Here is the revised paragraph without mentioning an image:

---

Your shopping cart webpage includes a table listing five items—Coke, Kit Kat, Bar One, Fanta,
 and Lunch Bar—each with columns for item number, price, quantity, total, and buttons to add or remove items,
  with all quantities and totals currently at zero. Using this shopping cart, the task is to complete the 
  project by ensuring the *Remove* buttons correctly decrease the quantity without allowing negative values,
   and by adding a *Checkout* button that calculates the total cost of all items and displays the final amount 
   on the page using a new function.

HTML
Here is a clear summary of your code in paragraph form:

---

This code sets up the basic structure of a shopping cart webpage. It links to an external CSS file
 for styling and a JavaScript file where the shopping cart functions are stored. When the page loads,
  it runs the `display_all()` function, which is likely responsible for showing the shopping cart items.
   The body includes a placeholder paragraph element (`demo`) for displaying information, a *Checkout* button 
   that triggers the `checkout()` function, and an empty paragraph (`checkoutTotal`) where the final total 
   price will appear.
    

  JS  
  Here is a clear summary of the JavaScript code in paragraph form:

---

This JavaScript code manages all the logic for the shopping cart. It begins by creating arrays for item numbers,
 product names, prices, quantities, and totals, along with a variable to track the overall order amount.
  The `add_selection()` function increases the quantity of a selected item, updates its total price,
   recalculates the overall order amount, and refreshes the display.
    The `remove_selection()` function decreases the quantity only if it is above zero, updates the item’s total,
     adjusts the order amount, and refreshes the table. The `checkout()` function displays the final total cost 
     in the designated HTML element. The `display_all()` function dynamically builds an HTML table showing all 
     items, their prices, quantities, totals, and Add/Remove buttons, then inserts this table into the page.
      Finally, when the page loads, it automatically calls `display_all()` to show the shopping cart.


CSS

Here is a clear summary of your CSS code in paragraph form:

---

This CSS file styles the shopping cart table and checkout section. It sets the table to use Arial or a similar
 sans-serif font, collapses the borders, stretches the table to full width, adds rounded corners, and applies a
  double green border for emphasis. All table cells and headers have a solid black border, left-aligned text, 
  and padded spacing to improve readability. Every even-numbered row is highlighted with a pink background to 
  create alternating row colors. Lastly, the `checkoutTotal` section is given an aqua background to make the 
  displayed total stand out on the page.
